# Recursive_Functions

Welcome to the **Recursive_Functions** repository! This project consists of two subrepositories:

1. **Word-to-Number Project**: A Python function that converts integers to their word equivalents (e.g., `100` to 'one hundred').
2. **Samples**: A collection of recursive functions, including examples like `factorial`, `Fibonacci`, and finding the maximum value in a list.

## Subrepositories

- **Word-to-Number Project**: Explore a useful utility to transform numerical values into their written form. 
- **Samples**: Dive into various recursive algorithms, demonstrating essential concepts in recursion.
