# Sorting Algorithm
## Description
This project strengthens the grasp of Python through the practical implementation of sorting algorithms. This project focuses on three primary sorting algorithms - Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort.

We'll compare these sorting algorithms' space and time complexity to grasp the concept of algorithm efficiency further.

## Hints 
1. Start by understanding the algorithms, and time and space complexities.
2. Implement an algorithm at a time.
3. Break down the problem into smaller sub-problems.
4. Utilize Python's built-in `time` library to check time efficiency.
5. Make use of Python's `sys` library to measure space efficiency.
6. Optionally, create an interactive dashboard using Stramlit.

## Learning Outcomes
