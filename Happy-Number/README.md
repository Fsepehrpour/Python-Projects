# Happy Number 
This GitHub repository contains a Python script that determines whether a given number is a happy number. A happy number is a number that eventually reaches 1 when you repeatedly replace it with the sum of the squares of its digits. If the process results in a cycle that does not include 1, the number is considered "unhappy" or "sad."

This script provides a simple function `is_happy(num: int) -> bool` that checks whether a given number is happy.
