#### Description 
This repository is to create a Python script that navigates to a website, interacts with a dropdown menu, and fetches content for change detection using Chrome. 
To do this we use Selenium. 

#### Selenium
Selenium is a Python package used to automate web browser interaction. 
It is an open-source, automated testing tool used to test web applications across various browsers.
Selenium is a powerful tool for browser automation that can mimic user interactions such as clicking and selecting from dropdowns.

#### Steps
1. Install Selenium and WebDriver


**WebDriver** is a component of Selenium that provides a common interface to control browsers programmatically.
It acts like a bridge between your scripts and a web browser, allowing you to perform actions such as:
* navigating to web pages,
* clicking buttons,
* entering text into forms, and
* extracting data.
Each major browser has its own WebDriver, which understands and acts on the commands given by Selenium.

**Chrome WebDriver** specifically allows Selenium to interface with Google Chrome. 
It's a standalone server or executable that needs to be installed and configured to work with the Chrome browser.
